# 20 Time Project
Template for logging 20Time work and learning.  This file should be updated as a log file for the project, and any data files (if necessary) should be found within the repository.  

## **Topic (Elevator Pitch)**
* I will be creating a website to help female soccer athletes play their sport without injuries. My webpage will provide them free information with regards to injury prevention and recovery to get them back on the field as soon as possible. If I have extra time I would also like to add more sections to the website, such as drills that I recommend or links to instructional videos. To accomplish this I will be using HTML and CSS styling, as well as JS to make the website more appealing.  

#### **Week 1 Log (Sep 18 - 22)**
* This week I have nearly completed the intro to HTML and CSS tutorials and projects on Khan Academy so that I can learn how to design and create my webpage (I will finish this next week). I have also started brainstorming some of the main ideas and topics that I want my webpage to include and have looked into sources/ mentors. Finally, I pitched my idea on Google Classroom.

#### **Week 2 (Sep 25 - 29)**
* _Objective:_ Complete intro to HTML and create a long term plan for the project (i.e. general weekly objectives). Furthermore, I will keep brainstorming ideas of what information to include and how to arrange it.
* _Completed:_ This week I started a general website template to create my webpage on using Wix. I have also made an approximate long-term plan for my project and started brainstorming ideas of what information I would like to include on my website. Finally, I have made a list of mentors that I would like to reach out to.

#### **Week 3 (Oct 2 - 6)**
* _Objective:_ Work on writing up the material prevention section of the website and continue researching information.
* _Completed:_ I have now completed the home page of my website and am working on designing the subpages. I have almost finished writing my information on the prevention section.

#### **Week 4 (Oct 9 - 13)**
* _Objective:_ Finish the write up for injury prevention and my research for injury recovery. Additionally I would like to have done more work on the website design.
* _Completed:_ This week I completed writing all of the information that I know on injury prevention. I have also begun brainstorming my information for injury recovery and researching new tips online. Last but not least, I have started creating the prevention page of my website and have found a way to link the three main pages (the home, injury prevention and recovery pages) together.

#### **Week 5 (Oct 16 - 20)**
* _Objective:_ Finish the write up for injury recovery.  
* _Completed:_ I am nearly finished writing up my injury recovery information. I have also made minor changes to my webpage, such as figuring out how to attach a menu bar in the header and making more progress on the prevention page.

#### **Week 6 (Oct 23 - 27)**
* _Objective:_ Complete all written for injury recovery. Given that I will now have written all of my information and have an idea of what I want to know, I would like to contact my mentors for ideas and answers to any questions this week.  
* _Completed:_ I have completed my injury recovery write-up. That being said, I have decided that I would like to add both an injury recovery and prevention section for the head and hip (previously I only had lower body information on ankles, legs and knees.) I have also started asking my team trainer some questions on their recommendations on prevention.

#### **Week 7 (Oct 30 - Nov 3)**
* _Objective:_ I will complete my website design and perhaps contact another mentor. Furthermore, I will add the information that is given to me by my mentors. At this point, I will publish my website given that it contains enough information.
* _Completed:_ I have finally completed the write-up for all both my prevention and recovery pages and have designed the webpages. That being said, the amount of content that I have for my pages does not fit the original layout that I had, so I am going to need to change the design of my information pages. I have also so far only contacted one of my mentors and have not gotten the information from them, so I will try to contact the rest this week now that I've added my hip and head paragraphs.

#### **Week 7 (Nov 6 - Nov 10)**
* _Objective:_ Add a calendar to my website that includes different timelines for each injury recovery. Create videos that demonstrate some of the exercises and stretches and upload them to my website.
* _Completed:_ This week I wanted to start adding a stronger connection to computer science into my project. I wrote my own html and used CSS to style 2 of my main pages (the main injury recovery and injury prevention). Due to this addition I did not get the chance to publish the site or create the videos or pictures. That being said, I finally found a calendar template online that I can edit to demonstrate different recovery periods. I plan on using this to make different calendars and take pictures of them that will be displayed on my webpage.  

#### **Week 7 (Nov 13 - Nov 17)**
* _Objective:_ This week I want to make videos and input information from my mentors. I would also like to brainstorm other possible ways to incorporate computer science into my project. Furthermore, I intend on adding all of the pictures and hopefully the majority of the videos. Last but not least, I would like to do some more work on the calendars and publish the site.
* _Completed:_ I added all of the pictures and the majority of the videos that I took last week. My website is also now published. Finally, I discovered a new way for me to connect my project to computer science. I would like to try and use my work flow to code a picture of a calendar with the information on it that I want. I can then take a picture of the calendar that I've made with the recovery timelines and using html insert it on my website. 

#### **Week 7 (Nov 20 - Nov 24)**
* _Objective:_ Code the calendars with the different recovery timelines. I would also like to investigate changing the links that are in my website using html and css to make them hyperlinks.
* _Completed:_ This week I added more pictures of things like my personal roller and braces. I also added more details to my text because I got some information from my soccer team's therapist. Another significant thing that I did this week was learn how to use powershell and node to code a picture onto my browser. I would like to start using these to attempt to code calendars that I can take a picture of and insert on my blog. Last but not least, I attempted to use html to imbed my links to other websites and incorporate hyperlinks but was not successful. My links did not take me to the correct webpages, so I am still trying to figure this out.

#### **Week 7 (Nov 27 - Dec 1)**
* _Objective:_ There are two more videos that I would like to make to enhance my ankle prevention and recovery. I would also like to try once again to figure out how to make hyperlinks and further investigate coding my calendars instead of using pre-made templates.
