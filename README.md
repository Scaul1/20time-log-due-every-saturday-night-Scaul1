# 20 Time Project
Template for logging 20Time work and learning.  This file should be updated as a log file for the project, and any data files (if necessary) should be found within the repository.  

## **Topic (Elevator Pitch)**
* I will be creating a website to help female soccer athletes play their sport without injuries. My webpage will provide them free information with regards to injury prevention and recovery to get them back on the field as soon as possible. If I have extra time I would also like to add more sections to the website, such as drills that I recommend or links to instructional videos. To accomplish this I will be using HTML and CSS styling, as well as JS to make the website more appealing.  

#### **Week 1 Log (Sep 18 - 22)**
* This week I have nearly completed the intro to HTML and CSS tutorials and projects on Khan Academy so that I can learn how to design and create my webpage (I will finish this next week). I have also started brainstorming some of the main ideas and topics that I want my webpage to include and have looked into sources/ mentors. Finally, I pitched my idea on Google Classroom. 

#### **Week 2 (Sep 25 - 29)**
* _Objective:_Complete intro to HTML and create a long term plan for the project (i.e. general weekly objectives). Furthermore, I will keep brainstorming ideas of what information to include and how to arrange it.
* _Completed:_This week I started a general website template to create my webpage on using Wix. I have also made an approximate long-term plan for my project and started brainstorming ideas of what information I would like to include on my website. Finally, I have made a list of mentors that I would like to reach out to.
