# 20 Time Project
Template for logging 20Time work and learning.  This file should be updated as a log file for the project, and any data files (if necessary) should be found within the repository.  

## **Topic (Elevator Pitch)**
* I will be creating a website to help female soccer athletes play their sport without injuries. My webpage will provide them free information with regards to injury prevention and recovery to get them back on the field as soon as possible. If I have extra time I would also like to add more sections to the website, such as drills that I recommend or links to instructional videos. To accomplish this I will be using HTML and CSS styling, as well as JS to make the website more appealing.  

#### **Week 1 Log (Sep 18 - 22)**
* This week I have nearly completed the intro to HTML and CSS tutorials and projects on Khan Academy so that I can learn how to design and create my webpage (I will finish this next week). I have also started brainstorming some of the main ideas and topics that I want my webpage to include and have looked into sources/ mentors. Finally, I pitched my idea on Google Classroom. 

#### **Week 2 (Sep 25 - 29)**
* _Objective:_ Complete intro to HTML and create a long term plan for the project (i.e. general weekly objectives). Furthermore, I will keep brainstorming ideas of what information to include and how to arrange it.
* _Completed:_ This week I started a general website template to create my webpage on using Wix. I have also made an approximate long-term plan for my project and started brainstorming ideas of what information I would like to include on my website. Finally, I have made a list of mentors that I would like to reach out to. 

#### **Week 3 (Oct 2 - 6)**
* _Objective:_ Work on writing up the material prevention section of the website and continue researching information. 
* _Completed:_ I have now completed the home page of my website and am working on designing the subpages. I have almost finished writing my information on the prevention section. 

#### **Week 4 (Oct 9 - 13)**
* _Objective:_ Finish the write up for injury prevention and my research for injury recovery. Additionally I would like to have done more work on the website design. 
* _Completed:_ This week I completed writing all of the information that I know on injury prevention. I have also begun brainstorming my information for injury recovery and researching new tips online. Last but not least, I have started creating the prevention page of my website and have found a way to link the three main pages (the home, injury prevention and recovery pages) together. 

#### **Week 5 (Oct 16 - 20)**
* _Objective:_ Finish the write up for injury recovery.  
* _Completed:_ I am nearly finished writing up my injury recovery information. I have also made minor changes to my webpage, such as figuring out how to attach a menu bar in the header and making more progress on the prevention page. 

#### **Week 6 (Oct 23 - 27)**
* _Objective:_ Complete all written for injury recovery. Given that I will now have written all of my information and have an idea of what I want to know, I would like to contact my mentors for ideas and answers to any questions this week.  

#### **Week 7 (Oct 30 - Nov 3)**
* _Objective:_ I will complete my website design.  Furthermore, I will add the information that is given to me by my mentors. At this point, I will publish my website given that it contains enough information.

#### **Week 7 (Nov 6 - Nov 10)**
* _Objective:_ Add a calendar to my website that includes different timelines for each injury recovery. Create videos that demonstrate some of the exercises and stretches and upload them to my website.
